🧠 What is OOP? (Very Important)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style where we:

Model real-world things

Using objects

That interact with each other

👉 Java is 100% object-oriented (except primitives).

Real world example:

Car

Bank Account

Student

Order

User

Each has:

Data (state)

Actions (behavior)

🔹 1. Object
📌 Definition

An object is a real-world entity that:

Has state

Has behavior

Has identity

👉 In Java, everything revolves around objects.

📌 Example (Real World)

Student Object

State → name, rollNo, marks

Behavior → study(), giveExam()

📌 Example (Java Code)
Student s1 = new Student();


s1 is an object of class Student.

🧠 Key Points (Write this in notes)

Object is a runtime entity

Created using new keyword

Occupies memory (heap)

Multiple objects can be created from the same class

🔹 2. Class
📌 Definition

A class is a blueprint/template used to create objects.

👉 Class does NOT occupy memory
👉 Objects DO occupy memory

📌 Real World Analogy

Class = Blueprint of a house

Object = Actual house built from blueprint

📌 Example (Java Code)
class Student {
    String name;
    int rollNo;

    void study() {
        System.out.println("Student is studying");
    }
}

🔹 3. State (Instance Variables)
📌 Definition

State represents the data of an object.

👉 Stored using variables

📌 Example
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;
}

🔹 4. Behavior (Methods)
📌 Definition

Behavior defines what an object can do.

👉 Implemented using methods

📌 Example
class BankAccount {
    int balance;

    void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    void withdraw(int amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
}


✅ Why new is an operator, not a keyword

In Java:

Keyword → reserved word used only for syntax/structure
Examples: class, int, if, return

Operator → performs an action on operands and returns a result
Examples: +, =, instanceof, new
